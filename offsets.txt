GLOBAL VARIABLES = SUM(numberOfBytes(types(the prev variables not including itself)))
LOCAL VARIABLES = BP - SUM(theNumberOfBytes of the prev variables including itself)
PARAMETERS = BP + 4 + SUM(theNumberOfBytes(the parameters on the right not including itself))
RECORD FIELD = the same as global variables
